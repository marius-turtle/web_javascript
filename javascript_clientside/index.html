        <p>HTML-Parsing is NOT blocked while JS-scripts are getting downloaded simultaneously AND the script-tag does NOT get executed immediately after download finishes but after the parsing finishes. That will cause the scripts be run in order not like with async in a random order.</p>

        <h1>Async</h1>
        <p>HTML-Parsing is NOT blocked while JS-scripts are getting downloaded simultaneously to parsing, as soons as a script is downloaded parsing stops and the script gets executed.</p>
